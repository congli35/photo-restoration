**Effective date:** January 5, 2026

PhotoRestore ("PhotoRestore," "we," "our," or "us") provides an AI-powered photo restoration service. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## Information we collect

**Information you provide**
- **Account details:** name, email address, password or authentication credentials, and profile settings.
- **Photos and content:** images you upload for restoration and any resulting restored images.
- **Support and communications:** messages you send to us (e.g., contact form emails).

**Information we collect automatically**
- **Usage data:** pages viewed, features used, actions taken, and timestamps.
- **Device and log data:** IP address, browser type, operating system, user agent, and session identifiers.
- **Cookies and similar technologies:** used to keep you signed in, remember preferences, and measure site usage.

**Information from third parties**
- **Payment data:** payment status and subscription details from our payment processors (we do not store full card details).
- **Authentication providers:** if you sign in with a social login or passkey provider, we receive basic profile and authentication data.

## How we use your information
We use your information to:
- Provide and operate the PhotoRestore service, including processing your photos and delivering restored results.
- Maintain and secure user accounts, sessions, and access controls.
- Process payments, manage subscriptions, and prevent fraud.
- Improve product performance, reliability, and user experience.
- Communicate with you about service updates, billing, and support requests.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.

## How we share your information
We share information only as needed to run the service:
- **Service providers:** hosting, storage, analytics, email delivery, and payment processing partners that perform services on our behalf.
- **AI processing:** your photos may be processed by third-party AI providers to generate restored images.
- **Legal and safety:** if required by law, to protect rights and safety, or to prevent abuse.
- **Business transfers:** in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale (with appropriate safeguards).

We do not sell your personal information.

## Data retention
We keep your information for as long as needed to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. For photos (both original and restored), retention depends on your plan:
- **Free:** 1 day
- **Plus:** 7 days
- **Pro:** for as long as you maintain an active subscription

You can delete photos or your account at any time, which removes associated data except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

## Cookies and analytics
We use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, security, preferences, and analytics. You can control cookies through your browser settings, but some features may not work correctly if cookies are disabled.

## Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your choices and rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal information. You can also:
- Update account information in your settings.
- Delete photos you’ve uploaded.
- Request account deletion.

To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below.

## International data transfers
Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when transferring data internationally.

## Children’s privacy
PhotoRestore is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and revise the effective date.
