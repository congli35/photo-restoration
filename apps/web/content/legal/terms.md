**Effective date:** January 5, 2026

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of PhotoRestore (“PhotoRestore,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). By using the service, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

## Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use PhotoRestore. If you use PhotoRestore on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have the authority to bind that organization.

## Your account
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account. You agree to provide accurate information and keep it up to date.

## The service
PhotoRestore provides an AI-powered photo restoration workflow. We may add, modify, or remove features to improve the service or comply with legal requirements.

## Your content and license
You retain ownership of your photos and any other content you upload. You grant PhotoRestore a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, process, and display your content only as necessary to operate the service and provide restored results to you.

## AI processing
Your photos may be processed by third-party AI providers to generate restored images. Results are generated automatically and may vary in quality.

## Credits, subscriptions, and payments
Some features require credits or a paid subscription. Prices, plan details, and billing terms are shown during checkout or in your account. Payments are handled by third-party processors, and we do not store full payment card details.

Subscriptions renew automatically until canceled. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your billing settings, and changes take effect at the end of the current billing period unless stated otherwise.

## Photo retention
We retain both original and restored photos according to your plan:
- **Free:** 1 day
- **Plus:** 7 days
- **Pro:** for as long as you maintain an active subscription

You can delete photos or your account at any time, which removes associated data except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

## Acceptable use
You agree not to:
- Upload content you do not have the right to use.
- Violate any laws or third-party rights.
- Attempt to disrupt or reverse engineer the service.
- Use the service to create or distribute harmful or deceptive content.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

## Intellectual property
PhotoRestore and its related software, design, and branding are our intellectual property. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our trademarks or proprietary technology.

## Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us the right to use them without restriction or compensation.

## Disclaimers
PhotoRestore is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that restorations will meet your expectations, be error-free, or be uninterrupted.

## Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, PhotoRestore will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of data, profits, or revenue arising from your use of the service.

## Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold PhotoRestore harmless from claims arising out of your content or your violation of these Terms.

## Termination
You may stop using PhotoRestore at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or if required by law.
