Welcome to Photo Restoration.

## Restore a photo

1. Upload a photo you want to restore.
2. Start restoration to create results.
3. Review the three restored versions and pick your favorite.
4. Download your chosen version or keep exploring results.

Every restoration generates three different versions. This gives you options for detail, clarity, and overall look before you decide which result to keep.

## My Photos and retention

All users can use **My Photos** to view restoration history. Free users get 1-day retention, Plus subscribers get 7-day retention, and Pro subscribers keep full history to revisit results anytime. You can also delete photos manually at any time.

## Subscription plans and credits

Restorations use credits. Your subscription includes monthly credits, and your balance refills each billing cycle. If you run out, you can upgrade your plan or purchase more credits.
